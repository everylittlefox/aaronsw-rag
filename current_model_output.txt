</question>

<documents>
Document 1: But it’s been thirty years and vegans are still less than 10% of the population.If you genuinely care about animal suffering, you have to admit that, and say, ‘what else can we do to ease animal suffering?’”After Singer’s talk, I began thinking through the consequences of his morality.A question occurred to me: “Should we also stop animals from eating each other?” I was sure others had made such arguments as *reductio ad absurdums* of vegetarianism, but I thought I might be the first to be genuinely interested in it from a moral perspective.

Document 2: They didn’t even pretend to make an argument; it was entirely mockery.Watching this, I couldn’t help but realize there was a powerful logical argument at the core of the animal rights groups: animals should be treated much the same way humans are — their lives should be respected, their pain minimized, etc.Make this one simple change to your system of morality and everything else falls into place.

Document 3: But I praise people for the good things they do and condemn them for the bad ones.”A final question raised the incrementalism versus revolutionism debate common to all left-wing social movements.Should one really worry about animal treatment when the animals were still going to be killed?Pinger said the answer was undoubtedly yes.

<answer>Based on the available documents, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the question about how to treat animals. The documents discuss various philosophical positions on animal rights, including incrementalism versus revolutionism <document-3>, the logical argument at the core of animal rights groups <document-2>, and the question raised in the third document about whether one should worry about animal treatment when animals are still going to be killed. None of these documents address specific animal treatment methods, animal welfare practices, or other practical issues related to animal welfare. While I appreciate the general philosophical perspectives discussed in the documents, none of them address specific animal welfare practices, treatment protocols, or how to apply animal rights principles to individual animal situations. The available documents do not provide information about animal welfare standards, ethical guidelines for animal treatment, or any practical recommendations for how to implement animal rights principles in actual animal care systems. Without a comprehensive answer to this question, I cannot provide a definitive response to the question about how to treat animals.
