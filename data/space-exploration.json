    "question": "What is the environmental impact of rocket launches on Earth's atmosphere?",
    "documents": "Document 1: Autonomous navigation systems for planetary rovers have advanced significantly to overcome the communication delays that make direct control impractical. Modern rovers employ stereo vision, lidar, and advanced path planning algorithms to identify hazards and navigate safely without real-time human input. These systems classify terrain features and assess traversability before executing movements, with conservative safety margins to prevent mission-ending accidents in remote environments. The development of these capabilities has been driven by missions to Mars, where one-way light time delays of 4-24 minutes necessitate substantial onboard decision-making authority.\n---\nDocument 2: International cooperation has been central to major space exploration initiatives in recent decades. The International Space Station represents the largest collaborative engineering project ever undertaken, with modules and systems contributed by the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan, and Canada. This partnership model distributes costs while leveraging specialized expertise from each participating nation. Similar frameworks are being applied to lunar exploration through the Artemis Accords, which establish principles for peaceful cooperation while allowing participating countries to contribute components that align with their industrial capabilities and scientific priorities.",
    "answer": "The question about the environmental impact of rocket launches on Earth's atmosphere cannot be adequately answered using the provided documents. While the question relates to space exploration, the available information focuses on autonomous navigation systems for planetary rovers <document-1> and international cooperation frameworks in space exploration initiatives <document-2>. Neither document contains relevant information about rocket emissions, their atmospheric effects, the composition of exhaust products, or potential environmental concerns associated with increased launch frequencies. Without documents discussing specific propellant types and their emissions, atmospheric layers affected by launches, potential ozone impacts, or comparative environmental assessments of different launch systems, a comprehensive answer to this question cannot be provided."
