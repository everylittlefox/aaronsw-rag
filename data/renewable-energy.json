        "documents": "Document 1: Solar loans have emerged as a popular financing option for residential installations, allowing homeowners to own their systems while spreading payments over time. These purpose-specific loans typically offer terms of 5-20 years with interest rates ranging from 3-8% depending on credit score and loan duration. Unlike leases, solar loans provide homeowners with direct access to incentives including the federal solar investment tax credit, which currently offers a 30% tax credit on system costs. Many solar loans require no down payment and are designed so that monthly payments approximately match or fall below typical electricity bill savings, creating immediate positive cash flow for homeowners.\n---\nDocument 2: Several alternative financing mechanisms exist for residential solar beyond traditional loans. Solar leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs) allow homeowners to host systems owned by third-party providers, who handle installation, maintenance, and monitoring. These zero-down options typically provide immediate bill savings of 10-30% compared to utility rates, though the savings are generally less than with direct ownership over the system lifetime. Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) programs, available in some jurisdictions, provide financing repaid through property tax assessments, effectively transferring the obligation to new owners if the property is sold before the term ends.\n---\nDocument 3: Biomass heating systems burn organic materials such as wood pellets, chips, or agricultural residues to provide space heating and hot water for buildings. Modern systems feature automated fuel handling, precise combustion controls, and efficient heat exchangers that achieve thermal efficiencies of 75-90%. Compared to conventional oil or propane heating, biomass can reduce heating costs by 30-50% depending on local fuel prices and system efficiency. Though initial installation costs exceed fossil fuel alternatives, the significant operational savings typically provide payback periods of 3-7 years.
