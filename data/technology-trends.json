        "question": "Should I invest in cryptocurrency in 2024?",
        "documents": "Document 1: The cryptocurrency market in 2024 has matured substantially from its early volatile years. Institutional adoption has stabilized larger cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, though price fluctuations remain significantly higher than traditional investments. Regulatory frameworks have developed in most major economies, providing clearer guidelines but also imposing compliance requirements that have eliminated some speculative practices. Financial advisors typically recommend limiting cryptocurrency exposure to 1-5% of investment portfolios depending on risk tolerance. Investors should consider blockchain technology's fundamentals rather than simply chasing price movements. Due diligence should include examining development activity, real-world adoption metrics, and governance structures rather than social media hype.\n---\nDocument 2: Self-driving car technology has evolved through multiple stages of automation. Most commercially available vehicles offer Level 2 autonomy requiring driver supervision, though several manufacturers have begun limited deployment of Level 4 systems capable of fully autonomous operation within specific geographic areas. These geofenced services primarily operate as robotaxis in carefully mapped urban environments. Technical challenges include handling extreme weather conditions and unpredictable human behavior. Regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, with federal guidelines establishing safety standards while states maintain different requirements for testing and deployment.\n---\nDocument 3: Cryptocurrency investment considerations for 2024 include the emergence of regulated financial products. Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs now provide exposure to digital assets through traditional brokerage accounts without requiring direct cryptocurrency custody. These vehicles have attracted significant institutional capital and improved market liquidity. Simultaneously, central bank digital currencies have progressed from concept to implementation in several countries, potentially competing with private cryptocurrencies. Energy consumption concerns continue to influence the sector, with proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies gaining market share due to their significantly lower environmental impact compared to proof-of-work systems.",

        "question": "How can I protect my personal data online?",
        "documents": "Document 1: Protecting personal data online begins with password management. Security experts recommend using unique passwords for each service, generated through password managers that create complex combinations resistant to brute force attacks. Multi-factor authentication provides a critical second layer of security, reducing account compromise risks by over 99% according to Microsoft research. Regular security audits of connected accounts help identify forgotten services that may have access to personal information. Users should review privacy settings on social media platforms quarterly, as these services frequently update their policies and defaults often favor data sharing rather than privacy. Consider using disposable email addresses for services that require registration but don't require ongoing communication.\n---\nDocument 2: Augmented reality shopping experiences are transforming retail through virtual try-on technologies. Fashion retailers have implemented systems allowing customers to visualize clothing items on their bodies without physically trying them on. Furniture companies enable realistic placement of products in customers' actual living spaces through smartphone cameras.
