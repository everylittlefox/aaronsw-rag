Higher-order functions either take functions as parameters or return them as results, enabling powerful abstractions like map, filter, and reduce operations on collections.

When the count reaches zero, the object is immediately reclaimed. While this provides deterministic cleanup, it struggles with reference cycles where objects reference each other but are inaccessible from the program.

        "documents": "Document 1: The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python's CPython implementation is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously. This design simplifies memory management and integration with C extensions but limits true parallelism on multi-core systems. The GIL doesn't block during I/O operations, allowing I/O-bound multithreaded programs to benefit from concurrency. However, CPU-bound threads will effectively run sequentially due to the lock, limiting performance gains from additional cores. The GIL has persisted in Python despite criticism because removing it would break backward compatibility with C extensions and potentially introduce race conditions.\n---\nDocument 2: Python provides concurrency through both threading and multiprocessing modules. The threading module enables multiple threads of execution within a single process, sharing memory space. It's useful for I/O-bound tasks where threads spend time waiting for external operations. The multiprocessing module, in contrast, spawns separate processes with independent memory spaces, bypassing the GIL limitation and enabling parallel execution on multiple cores. This approach is suitable for CPU-intensive tasks but incurs higher memory usage and inter-process communication overhead. The concurrent.futures module provides a high-level interface for both threading and multiprocessing with thread and process pools, simplifying the implementation of concurrent code.\n---\nDocument 3: Asynchronous programming in Python, primarily through the asyncio library, offers an alternative concurrency model without using multiple threads or processes. It uses a single-threaded event loop and coroutines (defined with async/await syntax) to handle concurrent operations without blocking the main thread. This approach is particularly effective for I/O-bound applications with many concurrent connections, such as web servers and network clients. Unlike threading, asyncio requires explicitly designed asynchronous code and libraries. Frameworks like FastAPI, aiohttp, and Tornado build on asyncio to provide high-performance web services. While asyncio doesn't bypass the GIL, it can efficiently handle thousands of concurrent connections with minimal resources compared to thread-based approaches.",

Core FRP concepts include pure functions (producing output solely based on input, without side effects), immutability (data cannot be modified after creation), and declarative programming (expressing what should happen rather than how). FRP uses streams or signals to represent values that change over time, with operations like map, filter, and reduce to transform these streams. This paradigm simplifies managing complex asynchronous operations and state changes by representing them as functional transformations of data streams, making code more predictable and testable.\n---\nDocument 2: Several libraries implement FRP principles across different programming languages. ReactiveX (Rx) provides a cross-language API for asynchronous programming with observable streams, available as RxJava, RxJS, and others. It offers operators for composing and transforming streams while handling concurrency. React, though not pure FRP, adopts reactive principles with its unidirectional data flow and virtual DOM for efficient UI updates. Cycle.js takes a more purist FRP approach, structuring applications as pure functions with side effects isolated through drivers.

This approach provides immediate feedback, making interpreters ideal for development and debugging. Languages like Python, JavaScript, and Ruby traditionally use interpreters.

Static type systems verify types during compilation, catching errors before execution, while dynamic type systems check types at runtime. Strong typing enforces strict type constraints, preventing implicit conversions that might lose information, whereas weak typing allows more flexible conversions between types. Type systems provide multiple benefits: they catch errors early, serve as documentation that helps developers understand code, enable compiler optimizations, and support IDE features like autocompletion and refactoring. However, they can add verbosity and complexity to code, particularly in languages with limited type inference.\n---\nDocument 2: Modern type systems incorporate advanced features that increase their expressive power and flexibility. Generics or parametric polymorphism allow code to operate on different types while maintaining type safety, such as creating collections that work with any element type. Type inference deduces types automatically from context, reducing annotation burden while preserving type safety. Algebraic data types combine types through products (tuples, records) and sums (enums, discriminated unions), enabling precise modeling of domain concepts. Dependent types allow types to depend on values, expressing complex invariants directly in the type system.

It focuses on managing access to shared resources and handling task coordination. Concurrency provides a way to structure programs with multiple independent tasks, particularly useful for responsive applications and I/O operations where tasks spend time waiting. Techniques for concurrent programming include threads, event loops, coroutines, and actors. While concurrent programming doesn't necessarily improve performance, it enhances program structure, responsiveness, and resource utilization. Concurrent programming introduces challenges like race conditions, deadlocks, and complex debugging, requiring careful synchronization and often leading to non-deterministic behavior.\n---\nDocument 2: Parallel programming specifically aims to execute multiple tasks simultaneously to improve performance through multi-core processors or distributed systems. It divides problems into subtasks that can be processed independently and combines their results. Parallel programs typically follow patterns like data parallelism (applying the same operation to different data portions) or task parallelism (executing different operations simultaneously). Common parallel programming models include OpenMP for shared memory systems, MPI for distributed memory environments, and CUDA/OpenCL for GPU computing. Effective parallel programming requires minimizing dependencies between subtasks, balancing workloads across processing units, and managing communication overhead. Performance scaling in parallel systems can be limited by portions that must execute sequentially, as described by Amdahl's Law.\n---\nDocument 3: JavaScript's event loop implements non-blocking I/O operations despite JavaScript being single-threaded. The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty, then moves callback functions from the task queue to the stack for execution. This model allows JavaScript to handle concurrent operations like network requests without blocking the main thread. The event loop prioritizes tasks in specific phases: timers (setTimeout, setInterval callbacks), I/O callbacks, idle/prepare (internal use), poll (retrieving new I/O events), check (setImmediate callbacks), and close callbacks. Microtasks like Promise callbacks have special priority, executing immediately after the current operation before the next event loop iteration. This mechanism enables JavaScript's asynchronous programming model with callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax, making it efficient for I/O-heavy applications despite lacking true parallelism.",

These services communicate through well-defined APIs, typically HTTP/REST or messaging systems. Each microservice manages its own data, either through separate databases or partitioned schemas. This approach enables independent development, deployment, and scaling of services, allowing teams to work autonomously with different technologies if needed. Microservices support organizational alignment by matching services to business domains and team structures. The architecture enhances fault isolation, as failures in one service don't necessarily impact others.

Monoliths are generally easier to debug since all components run in one process, eliminating network complexity. They offer better performance for interactions between components, as these occur through function calls rather than network requests.

Metacharacters like \\d (digits), \\w (word characters), and \\s (whitespace) represent common character groups. Capture groups (patterns in parentheses) extract matching text portions for later use.
